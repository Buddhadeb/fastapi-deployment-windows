# Deployment

In this section, we will guide you through deploying your FastAPI application as a Windows service using NSSM.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding with the deployment, make sure you have the following components installed:

- Python
- Non-Sucking Service Manager (NSSM)
- HTTP and Reverse Proxy Server (NGINX)
- Windows system

## Steps to Deploy FastAPI as a Windows Service

1. **Setting Up the Environment**: Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed.

2. **Creating the FastAPI Application**: Develop your FastAPI application.

3. **Running the FastAPI Application**: Test your FastAPI application to ensure it's working correctly.

4. **Deploying as a Windows Service with NSSM**: Use NSSM to convert your FastAPI application into a Windows service.

5. **Configuring NGINX as Reverse Proxy**: Set up NGINX to serve as a reverse proxy for your FastAPI service.

6. **Verifying the Deployment**: Test your deployed FastAPI service to ensure it's accessible and functioning as expected.
